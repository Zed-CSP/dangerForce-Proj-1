# Sneeze The Day!

## Description

We built this application to enable people to look up the pollution data for cities. Our initial motivation was to help those who were preparing to travel (or just to leave the house in their current city), but it's also for anybody who is just curious about air quality around the world. We hope to help people to be more prepared for the conditions when they go outside.

## Installation

## Usage

<!-- URL to come -->
View the [deployed application]().

- To view the air pollution data for a particular city, type the city name in the search bar.
    - If your search returns multiple results, choose the desired result from the pop-up dialog.
    - If you run an empty search or your search returns no results, a pop-up dialog will appear with an instructional message. Dismiss the dialog and run your search again.
- Color-coded air quality details for your city, as well as a gif that corresponds with the air quality index (higher index = bigger sneeze), will appear once your search returns a single result.
- Your search history will be stored in the "Tissue Box." Click on a city to search that city again.
